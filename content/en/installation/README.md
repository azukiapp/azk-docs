# Installation

Installing `azk` is really simple and it has packages available for both [Linux](linux.md) and [Mac OS X](mac_os_x.md).

The installation process will add the `azk` command to your system path, making it available in your terminal application.

## Mininum requirements

* 64-bit architecture machine
* Mac OS X or Linux (Windows: planned)
* bash (command-line tool available on virtually all unix systems)
* Internet connection (only needed while downloading [images](../imagens/README.md))
