# Getting started

Before you begin, make sure you have [azk installed](../ installation / README.md).

This guide will walk you through the first steps with `azk`, demonstrating the basics of its main features.

## Sample project

For your convenience we have a [sample project](https://github.com/azukiapp/azkdemo). It is relatively simple, but you can use it to test and understand the main features of `azk`.

To get a copy of the project, download [this file](https://github.com/azukiapp/azkdemo/archive/master.zip) and extract it in your project folder. You can also [clone this github repository](https://github.com/azukiapp/azkdemo).

> ** Note **: All commands `cd [path_demo]/azkdemo` in this guide, take into account that `[path_demo]/` is the path where the file above was extracted, be careful to always point to the correct path. ;)
